Day 8 Journal	

I spent almost every waking minute yesterday coding.  I had a 2 hour one-on-one mentoring session after lab 
with my friend who is a coder.  He helped cement some concepts for me.  I kept working, and then had another 2
hour 1-1 mentoring with my brother last night.  I called him after I broke down in tears feeling like a total idiot.
He walked me through building some functions and I had a few pieces really lock in for me last night.

Again, I feel like I am moving at a snails pace, but everyday I am learning and getting more proficient.  I am hoping 
I have a bit of time this weekend to upload and tweak all my old assignments that are incomplete.

This shit is hard, I love it, and I hate it, and I am all in!
